### CPSC 120

Lab 1 
This was one of my favorite labs during this semester. The reason why it is one of my favorite labs is that it was the first lesson where I first learned new things. I was able to create the folder and push my repository. 

Lab 2, part 1 
This was one of my favorite labs during this semester. It is because it was the lesson where I learned about the Arithmetic operators. Also, I was able to apply the information about what I learned from Arithmetic operators to coding.

Lab 7, part 2 
This was one of my favorite labs during this semester. It is because I knew about the rules of the Blackjack game before. Also, this is the first time I was able to apply the information that I already know about Blackjack to coding and writing functions about it.
